	* Stop ignoring EPIPE exceptions, as this is probably the
	  wrong thing to do. (Application is unaware of disconnected
	  clients and the CPU spins when sending large files to a
	  disconnected client.) Thanks to Ivan Sagalaev for bringing
	  this to my attention.

	  NB: Existing applications that use the flup servers may begin
	  seeing socket.error exceptions...

2006-05-18  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* Added umask keyword parameter to fcgi and fcgi_fork,
	  for use when binding to a UNIX socket.

2006-05-03  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* Fix illusive problem with AJP implementation. Thanks to
	  Moshe Van der Sterre for explaining the problem and
	  providing a fix.

2006-04-06  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* Catch a strange FieldStorage case. Seen in production.
	  Not quite sure what causes it.

2006-03-21  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* Add maxRequests option to PreforkServer. Patch provided by
	  Wojtek Sobczuk.

2006-02-23  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* Add paste.server_factory-compliant factories and respective
	  egg entry points. Thanks to Luis Bruno for the code.

	  Add debug option to servers, which is True by default.
	  Currently, only server-level error handling is affected.

	* Change the behavior of ImportingModuleResolver when dealing
	  with ImportErrors. Previously, it would act as if the module
	  did not exist. Now, it propagates the exception to another
	  level (outer middleware or WSGI). Reported by Scot Doyle.

2006-01-05  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* Improve Windows compatibility by conditionally installing
	  SIGHUP handler. Thanks to Brad Miller for pointing out the
	  problem and providing a fix.

2005-12-19  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* Fix socket leak in eunuchs socketpair() wrapper. Thanks to
	  Georg Bauer for pointing this out.

2005-12-16  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* Switch to setuptools for egg support.
	* Add higher-level 404 error page support. Thanks to Scot Doyle
	  for suggesting the idea and providing code. If you previously
	  subclassed Publisher to provide a custom 404 error page, this
	  is now broken. It will have to be massaged to fit the new
	  calling convention.

2005-11-28  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* Fix issue with FCGI_GET_VALUES handling. Thanks to
	  Timothy Wright for pointing this out.

2005-11-18  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@kalahari.flup.org>

	* When running under Python < 2.4, attempt to use socketpair()
	  from eunuchs module.

2005-09-07  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@europa.saddi.net>

	* Python 2.3 doesn't define socket.SHUT_WR, which affected
	  the closing of the FastCGI socket with the server. This would
	  cause output to hang. Thanks to Eugene Lazutkin for bringing
	  the problem to my attention and going out of his way to help
	  me debug it!

2005-07-03  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@europa.saddi.net>

	* Ensure session identifiers only contain ASCII characters when
	  using a non-ASCII locale. Thanks to Ksenia Marasanova for the
	  the fix.

2005-06-12  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@europa.saddi.net>

	* Cleanly close connection socket to avoid sending a TCP RST to
	  the web server. (fcgi_base) Fix suggested by Dima Barsky.

2005-05-31  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@ganymede.saddi.net>

	* Take scriptName from the WSGI_SCRIPT_NAME environment variable
	  passed from the web server, if present.
	* Check if scriptName is None, and if so, don't modify SCRIPT_NAME
	  & PATH_INFO. For better compatibility with cgi2scgi. (scgi_base)

2005-05-18  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@ganymede.saddi.net>

	* Change default allowedServers for ajp and scgi to ['127.0.0.1'].
	* Accept PATH_INFO from environment for scgi servers, in case
	  cgi2scgi is being used. Submitted by Ian Bicking.
	* Change threaded servers so wsgi.multiprocess is False by default.
	  Allow it to be changed by keyword argument.
	* Fix wsgi.multiprocess for scgi_fork. (Set to True.)

2005-05-15  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@ganymede.saddi.net>

	* Prevent possible deadlock related to DiskSessionStore locking.
	* Add logic to SessionStore so that it will block if attempting to
	  check out a Session that's already been checked out.

2005-05-14  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@ganymede.saddi.net>

	* Convert the use of decorators in session.py to something
	  compatible with Python <2.4.

2005-04-23  Allan Saddi  <asaddi@ganymede.saddi.net>

	* Ensure that SessionStore.checkOutSession() never returns an
	  invalidated Session. Reported by Rene Dudfield.
