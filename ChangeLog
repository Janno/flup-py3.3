	* Take scriptName from the WSGI_SCRIPT_NAME environment variable
	  passed from the web server, if present.
	* Check if scriptName is None, and if so, don't modify SCRIPT_NAME
	  & PATH_INFO. For better compatibility with cgi2scgi. (scgi_base)

	* Change default allowedServers for ajp and scgi to ['127.0.0.1'].
	* Accept PATH_INFO from environment for scgi servers, in case
	  cgi2scgi is being used. Submitted by Ian Bicking.
	* Change threaded servers so wsgi.multiprocess is False by default.
	  Allow it to be changed by keyword argument.
	* Fix wsgi.multiprocess for scgi_fork. (Set to True.)

	* Prevent possible deadlock related to DiskSessionStore locking.
	* Add logic to SessionStore so that it will block if attempting to
	  check out a Session that's already been checked out.

	* Convert the use of decorators in session.py to something
	  compatible with Python <2.4.

	  invalidated Session. Reported by Rene Dudfield.
